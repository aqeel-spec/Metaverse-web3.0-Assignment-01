        Stripping Names: Store a person's name, and include some whitespace 
        characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character 
        combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace 
        around the name is displayed. 
        Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
