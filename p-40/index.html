    <p>
        Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music 
        album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should 
        return a Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make 
        three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show t
        hat Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter 
        to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the 
        calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the 
        album's Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of 
        tracks on an album.
