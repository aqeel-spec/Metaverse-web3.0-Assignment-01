    <p>
        Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. 
        Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians 
        by adding the phrase the Great to each magician's name. Call show_magicians() 
        to see that the list has actually been modified.

    <h2>Project task 43</h2>
    <p>
        Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the function 
        make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians'names. Because the original
         array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array. 
         Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the 
         original names and one array with the Great added to each magician's name.
