    <p>
        Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

      <br/>  let car = 'subaru';

      <br/>  console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

      <br/> console.log(car == 'subaru')

      <br/> • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

      <br/> • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
    </p>
