        Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
         The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
         It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
         Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
          such as a color or an optional feature. 
        Print the Object that's returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
